/**
 * Issues requests and processes results from the OSRS hiscores website for each tracked skill to maintain lists of XP
 * milestones. Also controls rate limiting and retries, to limit strain on the hiscores page.
 * <p>
 * The objective is to ensure that these lists keep up with the player gaining XP. To accomplish this, an arbitrary
 * minimum list length is chosen `MINIMUM_LEADERBOARD_LIST_LENGTH`. If there are fewer milestones than the minimum list
 * size for a given skill, the LeaderboardManager will issue a request for more leaderboard data. At most one active
 * request may exist at a time for each skill.
 * <p>
 * All logic is performed on the main game thread as part of `onGameTick`, while requests are performed asynchronously.
 * Because of the asynchronous nature, LeaderboardManager operates on a state machine to ensure correct sequencing of
 * operations.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: the term `hiscore` already exists in RuneLite to indicate a player's specific hiscore page results. This class,
 * and related classes continue to use the term `hiscore` in that way, though references may be made to the
 * `hiscore servers`, which vaguely mean the black box of Jagex servers that provide all similar data. This project uses
 * the term `leaderboard` to refer to the array of entries containing [ranks, player names, levels, xp values],
 * ordered by rank for a single skill.
